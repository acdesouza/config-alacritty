* Alacritty

  My reason to use Alacritty is to have a Terminal Emulator capable of True Color, so I can use Vim with all the glorious colors of [[https://github.com/catppuccin][Catppuccin Theme]].

  Use [[https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v3.1.1/FiraMono.zip][FiraMono Nerd Font]] to have nice Terminal Icons.

  I like the behavior of automatically copying the selection to clipboard.

  I prefer to have a visual alert instead sound one. So, I don't need phones all the time. And I don't wake up the kids ;)
